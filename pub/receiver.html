While this receiver doesn't have any text, it's important to know that
Chromecast defaults to a black background with black text.  Changing that will
help your efforts.
We find that having everything fit in the HTML boxes tends to look nicer on TV
so, we also set overflow: hidden, which clips all flowing outside of boxes or
adding of scrollbars, which aren't useful on TV.
